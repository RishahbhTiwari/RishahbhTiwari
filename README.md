👋 Hey there! I'm Rishabh Tiwari

Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm an engineer-turned-aspiring "Data Scientist", currently deep-diving into the world of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and NLP (Natural Language Processing).
Now, I’m channeling my analytical mindset, structured execution, and curiosity into "Data Science" — mastering everything from foundational statistics to advanced AI techniques.


📚 What I’m Currently Learning

I’ve committed to mastering data science "end-to-end" — not just passively, but by deeply "implementing everything hands-on". I'm currently enrolled in:

- 🧠 Krish Naik’s Complete Data Science, Machine Learning & NLP Bootcamp
- ⚙️ Codebasics AI & Data Science Bootcamp

> I'm not just learning — I'm documenting, building, explaining, and teaching it back. Every line of code I write is part of a bigger mission: to become a full-stack data scientist.


🧠 Skills I'm Sharpening

📊 Core Data Skills
- Python • Pandas • NumPy • Matplotlib • Seaborn • Plotly

🤖 Machine Learning & Deep Learning
- Scikit-Learn • TensorFlow
- Regression • Classification • Clustering • Neural Networks • CNNs
- NLP (Text Preprocessing, TF-IDF, Word Embeddings)

📈 BI & Databases
- SQL • MySQL • PostgreSQL
- Power BI • Excel (Advanced)
- EDA • Data Wrangling • Business Dashboards

💻 Software
- Jupyter • Git & GitHub • VS Code

📂 Projects in Progress

I believe in learning by doing. Here are some projects I’m building (and documenting thoroughly):

- `Airbnb EDA`: Data storytelling with visual insights from Airbnb listings
- `Churn Prediction`: End-to-end ML pipeline for predicting customer churn
- `Resume Screener`: NLP-based resume classifier to automate shortlisting
- `Power BI Sales Dashboard`: Interactive BI dashboard with KPIs and trends
- `ML from Scratch`: A series where I implement core ML algorithms from first principles

👉 Stay tuned! More real-world case studies and portfolio projects are coming soon.


🛠️ Engineering Mindset + Data Science Thinking

With a background in managing real-world industrial projects, I bring:

- Structured problem-solving skills  
- Cross-functional coordination experience  
- Deadline-oriented execution  
- Strong documentation habits  
- An eye for operational & business metrics

I now apply these strengths to data pipelines, model building, and analytics storytelling.


📬 Let’s Connect!

I’m actively seeking "Data Analyst" and "Data Scientist" opportunities where I can grow, contribute, and apply what I’m building here.
